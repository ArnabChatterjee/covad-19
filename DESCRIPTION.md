# Shopping risk calculator

So  As a user by this App

## Section 1
Can check minimum amount of people in hospitals, shopping centers and ets.
          Example: for shopping centers how many people are there in the shopping centers in that time and which one is less crowded. then can              select best time to go for shopping/ or which hospital has less coronavirus cases close to his area for emergency conditions.

When user is walking can have alert to show less crowded place in my way before receiving there and can change my track to prevent contact.

## Section 2

Basic Idea: by asking about person's health information (such as fever, breath holding time,cough, ...) can save the person is sick or maybe sick and save this information.

So  As a user by this App

Can check minimum percentage of coronavirus risk in his/her selected location.
If you share with me your idea about my application idea I would appreciate it.
